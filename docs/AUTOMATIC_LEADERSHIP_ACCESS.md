# 🎯 Automatic Leadership Access - No Tokens Required!

## ✅ **Problem Solved: Leaders Don't Need to Enable Anything**

**Before:** Leaders had to manually toggle "Leadership Mode"  
**Now:** System automatically detects and provides leadership access when needed

---

## 🚀 **How It Works (Completely Automatic)**

### **For Leaders Without Jira Access:**

1. **Open the tool** → `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Go to Chat tab** → Start asking questions immediately
3. **System automatically detects** → No individual Jira access
4. **Auto-routes to leadership mode** → Uses shared service account or cached data
5. **Get executive insights** → No setup, no toggles, no tokens needed!

### **Visual Flow:**
```
Leader opens tool
     ↓
Asks: "Give me project status"
     ↓
System checks: Individual Jira access? → NO
     ↓
System checks: Leadership access available? → YES
     ↓
Auto-routes to leadership mode
     ↓
Returns: Executive-level insights with purple indicators
```
