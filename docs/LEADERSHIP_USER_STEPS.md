## For Executives & Leaders WITHOUT Jira Access

### 📱 **What You Need**

- ✅ Access to the company network (or VPN if remote)
- ❌ **NO Jira account needed**
- ❌ **NO API tokens needed**
- ❌ **NO technical setup required**

---

## 🚀 **Step-by-Step Instructions**

### **Step 1: Open the Leadership Quality Tool**
1. **Open your web browser**
2. **Navigate to**: `http://localhost:3000` (or ask IT for your company URL)
3. **You'll see the main dashboard** - this is the Leadership Quality Tool interface

### **Step 2: Enable Leadership Mode**
1. **Look for the "Enable Leadership Mode" button** (usually in the top section)
   - It has a crown icon 👑
   - May say "Leadership Mode OFF" initially
2. **Click the button** to enable leadership access
3. **Wait 2-3 seconds** for the system to check configuration

### **Step 3: Check Your Access Status**

You'll see one of three scenarios:

#### ✅ **Scenario A: Ready to Go!**
```
✅ Leadership Mode ON
🟢 Live Data  or  🔵 Cached Data
Updated 2 hours ago
```
**What this means**: You're all set! Skip to Step 4.

#### ⚠️ **Scenario B: First-Time Setup Needed**
```
⚠️ Setup Required
📋 Contact your IT administrator
```
**What to do**:
1. **Take a screenshot** of this message
2. **Contact your IT team** and say: 
   > *"Hi! I need leadership access enabled for the Quality Tool. I'm seeing a 'Setup Required' message. Can you please configure the shared service account? Thanks!"*
3. **Wait 10-15 minutes** for IT to configure
4. **Refresh the page** and try again

#### 📊 **Scenario C: Using Older Data**
```
📊 Leadership Mode ON  
🔵 Cached Data
Updated 6 hours ago
```
**What this means**: You can get insights, but the data is a few hours old (still valuable for strategic decisions).

### **Step 4: Start Getting Leadership Insights**

#### **Option A: Ask Questions in the Chat**
1. **Find the chat box** (usually at the bottom of the screen)
2. **Type your question in plain English**
3. **Press Enter or click Send**

#### **Option B: Use Quick Action Buttons** (if available)
- **"Portfolio Overview"** - Get a high-level view of all projects
- **"Team Capacity"** - See workload distribution
- **"Project Health"** - Check which projects need attention

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

### **"I can't access the tool"**
- **Check URL**: Make sure you're using the right address
- **Try different browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge

### **"Leadership Mode button doesn't work"**
- **Wait 30 seconds** and try clicking again
- **Refresh the page** (F5 or Ctrl+R)
- **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)

### **"I'm getting generic answers"**
- **Be more specific**: Instead of "status", ask "CCM project status"
- **Use project names**: Ask about specific projects you know
- **Try different phrasing**: "How are we doing with..." instead of just "status"

### **"Data seems really old"**
- **Check the timestamp** in the response
- **If older than 8 hours**, contact IT to refresh data
- **Ask IT** to enable "Live Data" mode for real-time insights

### **"I need help understanding the response"**
- **Ask follow-up questions**: "Can you explain this in simpler terms?"
- **Request specific actions**: "What should I do about this?"
- **Ask for priorities**: "Which of these is most urgent?"
